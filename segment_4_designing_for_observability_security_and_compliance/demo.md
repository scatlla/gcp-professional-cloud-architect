## Demo: Designing for Observability, Security, and Compliance

#### Requirements: 
- Firewall rules with minimal required access
- Least-privilege access permissions
- Restrict use of external IP addresses
- Configure a perimeter around sensitive data

#### Design 
- Firewall rules for the specific ports and protocols where traffic is being served. Leverage implicit deny behavior (see `configure_fw_rules.sh`).
- Prune service accounts and usersâ€™ permissions to minimal possible scope (see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#using_the_default_service_account)
- Apply Organization Policy constraints to restrict use of external IP addresses
- Configure VPC Service Controls to create a perimeter for Cloud Storage
